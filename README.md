# Yelp Dataset Analysis using Spark and Cassandra

## Overview
This application should analyses the yelp dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge).
In the first step it extracts the provided tar-file, parses the contained Json files and stores the outcome in a
scalable data store such as Cassandra or HDFS. After that, some basic Joins and Selects are executed to further analyse
the content of the data.

## Getting started


## Docker container


## Configuration
- Default: assuming DCOS, at least 3 nodes in cassandra
